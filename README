Paper Abstract:
Motivation: Alignment-free methods are increasingly used for phylogeny reconstruction, since they are
much faster than traditional alignment-based approaches. Existing alignment-free methods, however, are
less accurate than methods that are based on multiple sequence alignment.
Results: We propose Filtered Spaced Word Matches (FSWM), a fast alignment-free approach to estimate
phylogenetic distances between large genomic sequences. For a pre-defined binary pattern of match and
don’t-care positions, FSWM rapidly identifies spaced word matches between input sequences, i.e. gap-
free local alignments with matching nucleotides at the match positions and with mismatches allowed at
don’t-care positions. We then estimate the number of nucleotide substitutions per site by considereing
the aligned nucleotides of the don’t-care positions of the identified spaced-word matches. To reduce the
noise from spurious spaced-word matches, we use a filtering procedure where we discard all spaced-word
matches for which the overall similarity between the aligned segments is below a threshold. We show that
our approach can accurately estimate substitution frequencies even for distantly related sequences that
cannot be analyzed with existing alignment-free methods; phylogenetic trees constructed with FSWM
distances are of high quality. A program run on a pair of eukaryotic genomes of a few hundred Mb each
takes a few minutes.
